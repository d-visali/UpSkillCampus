My project is about Invoice Generator for Freelancers. It is a Python-based application designed to simplify the billing process for independent professionals. Freelancers often provide services to multiple clients and must create invoices to detail the work done, hours spent, and total payment due. This project automates that task by allowing users to input essential details such as the clientâ€™s name, service description, rate per hour, and hours worked. It then calculates the subtotal, applies a tax percentage, and generates a well-structured invoice with a unique invoice number and date. The final invoice is saved in a text file format for record-keeping and sharing.
